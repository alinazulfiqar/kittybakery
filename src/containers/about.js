              Living and working near New York City, we are always on the go.
              When Vivienne, our daughter, was diagnosed with severe food
              allergies as an infant, we came up short on healthy snacks that
              were safe to eat and delicious. Frustrated by the lack of options,
              Denise left her corporate job and set out to make her own. And
              thatâ€™s how Partake was born.

            <About.Text>
              Food allergies affect 1 in 13 children across our country, and
              according to Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), Black
              children are at a significantly higher risk of developing these
              allergies. Getting safe food into the hands of food insecure
              families with food allergies is a top priority for Partake. We are
              partnering with Food Equality Initiative to ensure families in
              need have access to the food, education and advocacy they deserve.
